Of course. For a Go backend project of this nature, a structure that promotes clear separation of concerns is crucial for good collaboration and maintainability. This allows different developers to work on separate features (e.g., posts, groups) with minimal code conflicts.

The following structure is based on best practices in the Go community, including the "Standard Go Project Layout," adapted to fit the specific requirements of your project's `README.md` file.

### Explanation of Directories

  * **`/cmd/server/main.go`**

      * **Purpose:** This is the main entry point of your application. Its only job is to initialize and start everything (e.g., read configuration, connect to the database, set up the router, and start the HTTP server).

  * **`/internal/`**

      * **Purpose:** This directory contains all the core application code. By placing it in `/internal`, you are telling Go that this code is private to this project and cannot be imported by other external projects. This enforces clean boundaries.
      * **Collaboration Benefit:** This is where your team will spend most of their time. The subdirectories clearly separate the different layers of the application logic.

  * **`/internal/api/`**

      * **Purpose:** This layer is responsible for handling all things related to the HTTP transport layer.
      * `/handlers/`: These files contain the functions that directly handle incoming HTTP requests. They are responsible for parsing request data (like JSON bodies), calling the appropriate service methods, and writing the HTTP response.
      * `router.go`: This file defines all the API endpoints (e.g., `POST /register`, `GET /posts/{postId}`) and maps them to the corresponding handler functions.

  * **`/internal/models/`**

      * **Purpose:** This directory contains the core data structures or "models" of your application (e.g., `User`, `Post`, `Group`). These are simple Go structs that represent your data.

  * **`/internal/service/`**

      * **Purpose:** This is the business logic layer. It contains the core application logic and orchestrates tasks. For example, the `auth_service.go` would contain the logic for hashing passwords and creating session tokens. It does not know anything about HTTP; it just executes business rules.
      * **Collaboration Benefit:** A developer can be assigned to work on the `group_service.go` without needing to touch the `user_service.go`, minimizing conflicts.

  * **`/internal/store/`** (also known as a repository or data access layer)

      * **Purpose:** This layer is solely responsible for communicating with the database. It contains all the SQL queries for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
      * **Collaboration Benefit:** It isolates all database logic. If you ever decide to switch from SQLite to another database, this is the only directory you would need to change.

  * **`/internal/websocket/client.go`**

      * **Purpose:** This file will define the `Client` struct and its methods. A `Client` represents a single user's connection. It's responsible for managing one specific WebSocket connection: reading messages from the user and writing messages back to them.

  * **`/internal/websocket/hub.go`** 

      * **Purpose:** The "Hub" is a central manager that runs as a background process. Its job is to:
          * Keep track of all active clients.
          * Handle client registration (when a new user connects).
          * Handle client un-registration (when a user disconnects).
          * Broadcast messages to all clients or a subset of clients (like in a group chat).

  * **`/internal/api/handlers/websocket_handler.go`**

      * **How it connects:** This handler acts as the entry point. Its job is to take an incoming HTTP request, upgrade it to a WebSocket connection, create a new `Client` object (from your `websocket` package), and register that new client with the `Hub`.

  * **`/pkg/`**

      * **Purpose:** As suggested by your `README.md`, this directory is for code that can be shared and used by external applications. The database setup is a perfect candidate.
      * `/db/`: This contains the database connection logic and the `migrations` folder as explicitly requested in your project instructions.

  * **`/configs/`**

      * **Purpose:** This holds configuration files. You should never hardcode things like server ports or database file paths. This file allows you to manage them easily.

  * **`Dockerfile`**

      * **Purpose:** The instructions to containerize your backend application, as required.

  * **`go.mod` & `go.sum`**

      * **Purpose:** These are Go's standard dependency management files.
