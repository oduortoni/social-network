# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds edit and delete functionality for comments in the social network application, similar to the existing post edit/delete functionality. Users will be able to modify or remove their own comments through a dropdown menu that also includes a follow option. The implementation will maintain consistency with the existing post management UI patterns and use the established global CSS color variables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a comment author, I want to edit my own comments, so that I can correct mistakes or update my thoughts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a comment they authored THEN the system SHALL display a three-dot menu icon next to the comment
2. WHEN a user clicks the three-dot menu on their own comment THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with "Edit", "Delete", and "Follow" options
3. WHEN a user selects "Edit" from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL open an edit modal with the current comment content pre-filled
4. WHEN a user modifies comment content in the edit modal THEN the system SHALL validate that the content is not empty
5. WHEN a user saves valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the comment in the database and display the updated content immediately
6. WHEN a comment is successfully edited THEN the system SHALL display an "edited" indicator next to the comment timestamp
7. IF the comment edit fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and keep the modal open

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a comment author, I want to delete my own comments, so that I can remove content I no longer want visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Delete" from their comment dropdown THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation modal
2. WHEN the delete confirmation modal appears THEN it SHALL ask "Are you sure you want to delete this comment? This action cannot be undone."
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the comment from the database and UI immediately
4. WHEN a user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation modal without making changes
5. IF the comment deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to follow other users from their comments, so that I can easily connect with people whose comments I find interesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any comment THEN the system SHALL display a three-dot menu icon next to the comment
2. WHEN a user clicks the three-dot menu on any comment THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with "Follow" option (and "Edit"/"Delete" if it's their own comment. Dont display the "Follow" if its their own comment.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the comment management interface to be visually consistent with the post management interface, so that the application feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the comment dropdown menu is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same styling as the post dropdown menu
2. WHEN modals are displayed THEN they SHALL use the global CSS color variables (--primary-background, --secondary-background, etc.)
3. WHEN hover effects are applied THEN they SHALL use --hover-background color variable
4. WHEN buttons are styled THEN they SHALL use appropriate color variables (--primary-accent, --warning-color, etc.)
5. WHEN the edit modal is displayed THEN it SHALL follow the same layout and styling patterns as the post edit modal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to only see edit and delete options on my own comments, so that I cannot accidentally try to modify other users' content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their own comment THEN the dropdown SHALL contain "Edit", "Delete", and "Follow" options
2. WHEN a user views another user's comment THEN the dropdown SHALL contain only the "Follow" option
3. WHEN the system determines comment ownership THEN it SHALL compare the current user ID with the comment author ID
4. IF a user attempts to edit/delete a comment they don't own THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and show an appropriate error message
