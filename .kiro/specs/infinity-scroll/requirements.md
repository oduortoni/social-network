   - Lazy load images and heavy content

3. **State Management**
   - Maintain posts array with proper pagination
   - Track loading states (initial, loading more, error)
   - Handle page numbers and offsets
   - Preserve scroll position on navigation

### Backend Requirements

1. **API Modifications**
   - Extend `/posts` endpoint with pagination parameters
   - Support `page`, `limit`, and `offset` query parameters
   - Return pagination metadata in response
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Response Format**
   ```json
   {
     "posts": [...],
     "pagination": {
       "currentPage": 1,
       "totalPages": 10,
       "totalPosts": 150,
       "hasMore": true,
       "limit": 15
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Implement query result caching
   - Handle concurrent requests efficiently
   - Set appropriate response timeouts

### Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile browser optimization (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
1. **Loading Times**
   - Initial page load: < 2 seconds
   - Subsequent batch loading: < 1 second
   - Image loading: Progressive/lazy loading
   - API response time: < 500ms

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Efficient DOM management for large lists
   - Implement virtual scrolling for 100+ posts
   - Garbage collection for off-screen content
